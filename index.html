			 <p>In 2021, a very active new member of our online community, the <strong>League of Foundry Devs,</strong> began peppering all of our channels with questions. You can usually tell when someone is going to &ldquo;stick.&rdquo; They were trying to be part of the community, rather than chase leads for a side project. We didn&rsquo;t know it yet, but they were about to be prolific.</p>
<p>The League was not just a hobby for us, it was a real community. In light of that, I had started a university initiative in there, partnering with my alma mater&rsquo;s center for open source to get students involved. This new member popped into that channel too, saying &ldquo;I hope to go to a university that has this.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s when we realized that our new active member was a <em>teen.</em></p>
<p>It made sense. One of our helpers was getting aggravated with all the questions. A lot of the answers they got were breadcrumbs to documentation that had all the information available, and yet they kept asking. To him, their questions were to the point of nagging curiosity more befitting a <em>child,</em> and they weren&rsquo;t wrong. It was impossible to ignore, however, that these questions were on a higher level and somewhat more &ldquo;effortful&rdquo; than we&rsquo;d expect of a teen.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s probably not fair to them for me to tell their whole story, and why they constantly surprised us. That&rsquo;s for them to tell. Within the leadership we were sometimes at odds, unable to agree at what level at which they should actively participate in community events. But we were very, very excited at their progress, as they had produced and completed a ton of projects that made an impact. We had a running thread of good (and a couple bad) examples of their member eligibility in the admin-only channel. In the end it was their own professionalism and their own adherence to our values that caused us to eventually invite them as a volunteer for new initiatives within the League.</p>
<hr>
<p>Next month I&rsquo;m doing Global Game Jam at a hackerspace in Gda≈Ñsk, and I&rsquo;m a little nervous about it. My spoken Polish is still terrible, and despite organizers' assurances otherwise, I&rsquo;m concerned about the language barrier.</p>
<p>I was relieved to have received an invitation to join a Game Jam team within a few days of signing up. My teammates told me, &ldquo;good, you will practice your Polish, we will master our English.&rdquo; For me this was a very comforting way of answering my concerns.</p>
<p>I also found out quickly that they&rsquo;re teens, but that doesn&rsquo;t concern me at all. I learned that teens who seek out professional/DIY spaces are among the most professional, dedicated individuals in their respective communities.</p>
<hr>
<p>The League&rsquo;s teen volunteer is now officially an adult in university. Last week, In our helpers-only channel, they shared a photo of themself leading a seminar in a lecture hall packed with fellow students. We&rsquo;re not as active as in 2021, but we all came out in support of this next level of leadership from them. It means a lot to us that they shared this latest achievement, but probably not as much as it meant to them to be able to share it.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://anthonyronda.com/2022/12/20/happy-d-day.html">Happy D20 Day</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://anthonyronda.com/2022/12/20/happy-d-day.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2022-12-20 17:31:21 -0500">Dec 20, 2022</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>In a past life (2020), I organized an event on December 20th called <strong>D20 Day</strong>. I envisioned it to be a day celebrating the 20-sided die used in tabletop games. In the meantime, however, it was a one-day hackathon for me and my newfound friends in the Javascript-loving &ldquo;Foundry module making&rdquo; scene (more on that someday).</p>
<p>I had bought the domain name for the occasion, but didn&rsquo;t really have time to complete the idea I had envisioned for the website.</p>
<p>Instead we notified gamers of the occasion directly on Discord. Each of us Twitch streamed our coding sessions for a couple hours, together comprising a full 24-hour broadcast. At the end of our shifts, each of us selected viewers to win software keys for <a href="https://foundryvtt.com">Foundry Virtual Tabletop</a> (randomly of course, at the roll of a die).</p>
<p>It was really the highlight of the year for our little coding troupe. We were all so excited to grow the event. But when the time came to plan our sequel, we decided that we were all quite busy doing our own things.</p>
<hr>
<p>Completely unbeknownst to me, the creators of Dungeons &amp; Dragons jumped on the D20 Day bandwagon in 2021. <a href="https://gamingtrend.com/news/d20-day-is-happening-on-monday-join-jack-black-michelle-rodriguez-and-more-at-10-am-pt-for-lost-odyssey-promised-gold/">A charity livestream</a> was announced starring <em>Deborah Ann Woll</em> as Dungeonmaster, with a supporting cast including <em>Michelle Rodriguez</em> and <em>Jack Black.</em></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m happy that this novelty holiday found a worthy cause in Children&rsquo;s Miracle Network Hospitals. And I believe they decided not to register a trademark for D20 Day out from under me, a nice change of habit for Hasbro. Sadly, it seems like there won&rsquo;t be a repeat performance this year.</p>
<p>Since the first D20 Day, I&rsquo;ve pondered all sorts of schemes to celebrate enumerated icosahedrons in a way that respected the original spirit of the holiday (namely, non-corporate). Let&rsquo;s be realistic though, I don&rsquo;t have a lot of time for event planning, so that little unfinished webapp I cooked up in 2020 is going to collect dust on the hard drive just a little longer.</p>
<hr>
<p>You could almost call it timely‚Äìa cottage community of adventure writers and cartographers, who republish snippets of the open-licensed version of Dungeons &amp; Dragons, are getting fearful for their future. Over the last week or so, they&rsquo;ve campaigned for Hasbro-subsidiary Wizards of the Coast to confirm support for the open license in the next edition of the game.</p>
<p>I say this <em>could</em> be timely because &ldquo;d20&rdquo; used to be the official trademark these third-party authors were allowed to use to signify &ldquo;D&amp;D-compatible,&rdquo; before that too was taken away. D20 Day could yet again be a force for change&hellip;</p>
<p>But I say &ldquo;almost,&rdquo; because it&rsquo;s hard for me not to think of these creators' social media campaigns as rent-seeking. I don&rsquo;t feel comfortable for purely commercial interests to come out ahead of what matters:</p>
<p>Randomness, chaos. The clacking and clattering cacophany of plastic resin.</p>
<p>The sanctity of D20 Day must be protected, even if it means rolling for stealth this time.</p>
